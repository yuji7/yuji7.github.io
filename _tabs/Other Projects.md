## BSc Project: **Simulation on the Evanescent Scattering of Gold Nanoparticles.**

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/bsc.gif" alt="bsc" width=500>

In this project, I simulated the feasibility of a novel method to detect ultrasound via oscillating gold nanoparticles placed inside a PDMS, scattering evanescent waves coupled into a fibre. I used SMUTHI, a python library to simulate the evanescent scattering of gold nanoparticles as various distances.

## MSci Project: **Volumetric Photopolymerization of Optical Microstructures**

In this project, I used a fourier microscope setup to focus light onto a photoresist and fabricate 3D microstructures using volumetric photopolymerization. I was able to predict structures using a 2D power-threshold model.
